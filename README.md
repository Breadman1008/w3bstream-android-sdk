# W3bstream Android SDK

W3bStream is a general framework for connecting data generated by devices and machines in the
physical world to the blockchain world. In a nutshell, W3bStream uses the IoTeX blockchain to
orchestrate a decentralized network of gateways (i.e., W3bStream nodes) that streams encrypted data
from IoT devices and machines and generates proofs of real-world facts to different blockchains.

See the [project website](https://handbook-mug-590108.framer.app/) for documentation and APIs.
